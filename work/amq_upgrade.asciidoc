## Testing AMQ upgrade

Tests upgrading from RHMI `v2.1.0` -> `v2.2.0` in which the AMQ `v1.4.1` is installed via OLM, along with AMQ's monitoring resources.

### Install RHMI v2.1.0 via OLM

- `oc login` to your OS4 cluster
- login to `quay.io`
- Push the `integreatly-operator 2.1.0` CSV to your own quay.io application registry. From master, run:
`QUAY_USERNAME=<your user> QUAY_PASSWORD=<your password> REPO=<your quay name> make push/csv` (requires operator courier)
- Within `quay.io`, make the application public (applications -> settings -> make public)
- Create an operator source on the cluster:
```
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorSource
metadata:
  name: rhmi
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  authorizationToken: {}
  displayName: RHMI Operators
  endpoint: 'https://quay.io/cnr'
  publisher: Integreatly Publisher
  registryNamespace: <The REPO you used above>
  type: appregistry
```
- Run: `make cluster/prepare/project && make cluster/prepare/smtp && make cluster/prepare/dms && make cluster/prepare/pagerduty`

- Manually create an automatic subscription for RHMI on  the cluster through OLM, in the `redhat-rhmi-operator` namespace
- Wait for `RHMI` to install

### Upgrading to this branch
- Checkout this branch
- `make release/prepare SEMVER=2.2.0`
- Within the newly created CSV file, update the `image` value to point to your `quay.io` repositiory. Also update the `ORG` in the makefile to point to your `ORG`
- `make image/build`
- Push the new CSV to quay: `QUAY_USERNAME=<your user> QUAY_PASSWORD=<your password> REPO=<your quay name> make push/csv`
- Push the new image to quay: `make image/push`
- Make the `integreatly-operator` repository public in quay, if it isn't already (repositories -> settings -> make public)
- Delete the `rhmi-x` pod in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace
- In the `redhat-rhmi-operator` namespace, navigate to Installed-Operators -> RHMI -> subscription and approve the updgrade
- Ensure the upgrade was successful, and the following alerts exist in Prometheus and none of the alerts are in a triggered state (you may have to wait a few minutes for the upgrade to take affect):
